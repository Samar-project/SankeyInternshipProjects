# SankeyInternshipProjects
this is the first project where a hospital database is created using MySQL
where user can register as a patient, employee (doctor,nurse,etc.)
then patient can register in ward with disease, ward no, doctor assigned, prescription, personal info etc.
there we can perform many other activities like trigger, procedure function etc.
